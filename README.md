# lottery
This is a joke project. But in any joke there is truth. :)
Goal of this project - check popular lottery 6 from 45. My hypothesis was that if this lottery is scam, then results of lottery will be predictable. I collected data from 3000 editions of the lottery, train neural network, and check it on next results of lottery. But in this experiment a don't found any correlations in results.

For training we need dataset with results of lottery in csv format. In other csv file fill last results  of lottery. Important: fill blank fields with 0 (zeroes). Zeroes in fields needs because i did not invented how do this in lua. Openoffice does this task more fast then me. :)
